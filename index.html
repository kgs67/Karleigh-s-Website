  <h2>Field or Career</h2>

  <p>   I am studying Law, Criminal Justice, and Society at the University of Pittsburgh. I plan on completing my undergrad here and hopefully attending Law School at either Pitt or Duquesne. Pictured below is myself and my two highschool bestfriends, Olivia and Julie.</p>

<!--You don't need an image here if you don't want one!-->

<!--Between these divisions, you may want to add a new div element like an image (see the bottom of this html page for instructions) It's always worth thinking about how a user navigates your site. How do you want to break up the experience of scrolling down here? How might it feel on a laptop, phone, or tablet?-->

<!--Here's another div, same as before. Note the question about putting an image behind the text. You could give this section a different class with a different background--image or color.-->

<!--This image sits above your description below, but could it be the background like the hero image? You might try and modify this <div> by giving it a new class that mirrors the "hero-image" above. You can take care of that in the CSS. -->

  <p>This is my cat, Lola. She is 6 years old. She was a rescue from a litter of kittens that was born in a barn. She's my bestfriend even though she's very very grumpy. I miss her a lot :(</p>

  <h2>Encomium Essay</h2>
  <p>My encomium essay deals with the use of Artificial Intelligence and technology as a whole. My essay talks about the short story written by Harlan Ellison titled, "<i>I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream</i>". This story is a futuristic narrative about the dangers of humans abusing Artificial Intelligence. I believe the story serves as a very good warning against technological misuse. Even though the future in the story is highly improbable, the fear it could be real is a good warning.'</p>
